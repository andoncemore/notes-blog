This article was a review of the book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff. This **long** book review gives context to Zuboff's ideas, and then critiques those ideas.

### Ideas

Zuboff's previous work talks about a binary choice for corporations between automating and informating.

`Automating:` Information technology strips workers of their autonomy and condemns them to undignified tasks

`Informating:` Gather data related to computer-mediated work. By rationalizing worker's tacit knowledge, you can lower costs

In this new book, Zuboff follows this distinction with a new idea of advocacy-oriented capitalism vs. surveillance capitalism.

`Behavioral Surplus:` Created when tech firms use extracted data for targeting ads and **modifying behavior**

`Behavioral Reinvestment Cycle:` Follows the utopian path of informating, data is used to **improve services** for the customer.

`Advocacy-Oriented Capitalists:` Companies that use a behavioral reinvestment cycle, to improve services.

`Surveillance Capitalists:` Companies that follow use data as behavioral surplus, to modify behavior

According to Morozov, Zuboff's has a couple of potential theses:
1. "Data is being appropriated--extensively, rationally, nefariously--and efforts to monetize it occasionally have deleterious social effects"
2. Surveillance capitalism produces effects that are worse than alternative digital regimes, and becoming the hegemonic form of capitalism. Today's capitalists must worry about the means of behavioral modification, not the means of production.
3. "Surveillance capitalists engage in surveillance capitalism because this is what the imperatives of surveillance capitalism demand"

The first one is probably true, but a bit boring. The third one doesn't actually explain anything. If second thesis is actually interesting, but she needs to prove it. If she can't, then we are either at Thesis 1 or 3.

So looking closer to Thesis 2, these are the things that Zuboff would need to prove:
* We can choose between either surveillance capitalism or advocacy capitalism
* Both of these use data extraction, one to modify behavior, the other to improve services
* Current society favors surveillance capitalism over advocacy capitalism
* The imperatives of surveillance capitalism overpower those of capitalism itself.
* The social effects of surveillance capitalism is worse than it's alternatives

### A Bit of History
The context for Zuboff's theories can be found in Managerial Capitalism and a Chandler-Parsons framework. 

`Managerial Capitalism:` Alfred Chandler argued that large businesses are more efficient because of the ability of managers to coordinate things better than the market.

`Parsonian:` Talcott Parsons had a functionalist approach to sociology. As broader historical change occurs, social systems adapt.

In a Chandlerian framework, you use history to just find evidence that proves your model. In this analytical model, "change is propelled by adaptation and evolution, not by power struggles and revolution." But it is never compared against other analytical models, and historical evidence is cherry-picked to prove the model.
