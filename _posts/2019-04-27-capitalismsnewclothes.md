This article was a review of the book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff. This **long** book review gives context to Zuboff's ideas, and then critiques those ideas.

## Ideas

Zuboff's previous work talks about a binary choice for corporations between automating and informating.

`Automating:` Information technology strips workers of their autonomy and condemns them to undignified tasks

`Informating:` Gather data related to computer-mediated work. By rationalizing worker's tacit knowledge, you can lower costs

In this new book, Zuboff follows this distinction with a new idea of advocacy-oriented capitalism vs. surveillance capitalism.

`Behavioral Surplus:` Created when tech firms use extracted data for targeting ads and **modifying behavior**

`Behavioral Reinvestment Cycle:` Follows the utopian path of informating, data is used to **improve services** for the customer.

`Advocacy-Oriented Capitalists:` Companies that use a behavioral reinvestment cycle, to improve services.

`Surveillance Capitalists:` Companies that follow use data as behavioral surplus, to modify behavior

## A Bit of History
The context for Zuboff's theories can be found in Managerial Capitalism and a Chandler-Parsons framework.

`Managerial Capitalism:` Alfred Chandler argued that large businesses are more efficient because of the ability of managers to coordinate things better than the market.

`Parsonian:` Talcott Parsons had a functionalist approach to sociology. As broader historical change occurs, social systems adapt.

In a Chandlerian framework, you use history to just find evidence that proves your model. In this analytical model, "change is propelled by adaptation and evolution, not by power struggles and revolution." But it is never compared against other analytical models, and historical evidence is cherry-picked to prove the model.

## Critique

According to Morozov, Zuboff's has a couple of potential theses:
1. "Data is being appropriated--extensively, rationally, nefariously--and efforts to monetize it occasionally have deleterious social effects"
2. Surveillance capitalism produces effects that are worse than alternative digital regimes, and becoming the hegemonic form of capitalism. Today's capitalists must worry about the means of behavioral modification, not the means of production.
3. "Surveillance capitalists engage in surveillance capitalism because this is what the imperatives of surveillance capitalism demand"

The first one is probably true, but a bit boring. The third one doesn't actually explain anything. If second thesis is actually interesting, but she needs to prove it. If she can't, then we are either at Thesis 1 or 3.

So looking closer to Thesis 2, these are the things that Zuboff would need to prove:

**A.** We can choose between either surveillance capitalism or advocacy capitalism

Advocavy-oriented capitalism is as capitalist as the surveillance brand. In the absence of advertising, it is deemed to be free from the power imbalances of unequal exchange.

**B.** Both of these use data extraction, one to modify behavior, the other to improve services

If Amazon is harvesting our Alexa data, it could be doing so to modify our behavior to extract more data. But they also could be just to improve its voice recognition, which it monetizes through AWS, the main source of profits.

Also, its not clear why a tech company is interested in behavioral surplus. The hunt for behavioral surplus becomes the cause, not the effect, of what tech companies do.

A simpler theory would be that
> "tech firms... are driven by long-term profitability. They achieve it by externalizing the costs of their operations and leveraging their political power. Data extraction and the behavioral modification it enables...arise, where they do, in that context"
#### Capitalism's New Clothes, Section 10

**C.** Current society favors surveillance capitalism over advocacy capitalism

Zuboff doesn't explain why surveillance capitalism has prospered at the expense of advocacy captitalism. The hegemony is postulated, not proven.

**D.** The imperatives of surveillance capitalism overpower those of capitalism itself.

It's unclear whether the hunt for behavorial surplus is why Facebook and Google aquired companies. Looking just at what happened, it's not clear.

**E.** The social effects of surveillance capitalism is worse than it's alternatives

There is no framework proposed to compare the harms of surveillance capitalism to any alternatives. The only solution is to assume that there is no alternative, that surveillance capitalism is hegemoic.

## Critique of Academic Scholarship

[Evaluating Scholorship, or why I won't be teaching Shoshana Zuboffs The Age of Surveillance Capitalism ](https://blaynehaggart.wordpress.com/2019/02/15/evaluating-scholarship-or-why-i-wont-be-teaching-shoshana-zuboffs-the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism/)

The points in this article will be useful to keep in mind when I'm writing academic papers.

1. Exxagerated claims to novelty:
There is **always** a precendent.
2. Absence of relavent literatures:
"Scholarship is a conversation, so who are you responding to? How do you relate to their work?"
3. Unclear framework:
Zuboff does not show her work. Morozov's review is mostly spent puzzling out her analytical framework.
4. Use of hyperbole:
One's argument stops relying so much on reason, logic, and evidence and begins relying on how it make the reader feel.
