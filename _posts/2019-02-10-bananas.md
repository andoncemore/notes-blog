While one way to understand the scale of the city is from a satellite perspective, another way to think about it is as a series of collective understandings of smaller portions of the city. My project thus far has been about using the act of making a Roaming View Shoe as a tool for me to start to understand parts of Condesa, Roma and Centro. Moving forward, I want to investigate these collective understandings of the city, in contrast with an individualâ€™s understanding.
