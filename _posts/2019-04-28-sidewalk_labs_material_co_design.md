In response to Sidewalk Labs' "Digital Transparency in the Public Realm" project, Shannon Mattern has written this critique.

The project asks "What if you could quickly communicate what technology was in use in the public realm in a way that was transparent and clear without being overwhelming?"

> By "providing transparency", Sidwalk helps people "increase their awareness" - their "literacy" - "of how digital technology in the public realm works."

In this case, the transparency isn't about having discussions about whether we should have these technologies in the public sphere or not. With the initial framing of this project, we lose sight of the bigger questions:
> "about whether we want cities built in the image of corporate internet, whether all digital infrastructures are necessarily in the public interest, and wheather a public's acts of citizenship should be reduced to filling out co-design cards and training Alphabet's algorithms."

I've been thinking about "systems legibility", but this critique poses a good question - `To What End?` With the predictive policing algorithms, it doesn't help to just make those systems visible, they also have to be dismantled. A redesigned predictive policing system would just distract from the actual issues with that system.

The question then becomes by what processes does that "redesigned" system actually contribute to the dismantling? Maybe if it's designed not as solution, but as a conversation tool (a la Adverserial Design). But conversation is not enough...
