This blog post by Tobias Revell put to words some of my thoughts on speculative design. I'll run through his 5 problems and share my thoughts. These are broad generalizations, maybe I'll find some counter-examples a bit later.

### 1. "Speculative Design has been separated from it's critical origins..."
When you look a bit closer at the "critical origins" referenced here, like Superstudio, the design work doesn't actually seem that critical. The work seems critical in the broadest sense, and doesn't actually reference any people specifically, just "unjust social divisions". This sense of criticality does show up in most Speculative Design that says it is critical. It does its work in the most generic way possible, and uses white people as the default. The blog post does imply this, but doesn't say it explicitly.

### 2. "Speculative design reinforces one particular (European social democratic) notion of 'better'..."
I think that this point connects to my thoughts on problem 1. All of speculative design is generally done from the frame of reference of the designer, who are usually from the West. By engaging people from different backgrounds, or from the Global South, speculative designers could push back against these norms.

### 3. "No amount of good [UX] design can counteract the reward function of a destructive and exploitative techno-industrial complex"
The core of speculative design is to use frameworks of product design to critique. If you stop doing the critique part, then you are simply contributing to futures of surveillance capitalism. I agree with the author here that the focus on products allows speculative designers to focus on the "user" rather than the systemic issues that they should be critiquing.

### 4. "User/human centered approaches ignore post-human scale technological and ecological ruin in the pursuit of individualism for profit"
I generally agree with this point that design (not just speculative design) is focused entirely on the individual, rather than the collective.

### 5. "Speculative design elicits change through the trickle-down effect. This lacks the urgency..."
This has been my main issue with Speculative Design since being introduced to it four years ago. The theory of change for speculative design is that people will see this work, and then become more conscientious. Just hoping for this to be true is a cop-out for people to feel like their work is important, when in reality it "lacks urgency". I think it's lazy to assume that speculative design work will have this trickle-down effect.

I'm sure I'll refine some of my thoughts moving forward, but it's a starting point.
