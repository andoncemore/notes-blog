While one way to understand the scale of the city is from a satellite perspective, another way to think about it is as a series of collective understandings of smaller portions of the city. My project thus far has been about using the act of making a Roaming View Shoe as a tool for me to start to understand parts of Condesa, Roma and Centro. Moving forward, I want to investigate these collective understandings of the city, <a href="http://aditd.me">in contrast with an</a> individualâ€™s understanding.

<h2>This is 2nd level heading</h2>
<p>This is a test paragraph.</p>
<h3>This is 3rd level heading</h3>
<p>This is a test paragraph.</p>
<h4>This is 4th level heading</h4>

<h5>This is 5th level heading</h5>

<h6>This is 6th level heading</h6>
<p>This is a test paragraph.</p>

<h2>Basic block level elements</h2>

<p>This is a normal paragraph (<code>p</code> element).
To add some length to it, let us mention that this page was
primarily written for testing the effect of <strong>user style sheets</strong>.
You can use it for various other purposes as well, like just checking how
your browser displays various HTML elements by default.
It can also be useful when testing conversions from HTML
format to other formats, since some elements can go wrong then.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph. I think it needs to be added that
the set of elements tested is not exhaustive in any sense. I have selected
those elements for which it can make sense to write user style sheet rules,
in my opionion.</p>
<br>
<div>This is a <code>div</code> element. Authors may use such elements instead
of paragraph markup for various reasons. (End of <code>div</code>.)</div>
<blockquote><p>This is a block quotation containing a single
paragraph. Well, not quite, since this is not <em>really</em>
quoted text, but I hope you understand the point. After all, this
page does not use HTML markup very normally anyway.</p><h4>The New Dark Age - Page 4</h4></blockquote>
<p>The following contains address information about the author, in an <code>address</code>
element.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Lists</h2>

<p>This is a paragraph before an <strong>unnumbered</strong> list (<code>ul</code>). Note that
the spacing between a paragraph and a list before or after that is hard
to tune in a user style sheet. You can't guess which paragraphs are
logically related to a list, e.g. as a "list header".</p>
<ol>
  <li> One.
  <li> Two.
  <li> Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer. Note that
for short items lists look better if they are compactly presented,
       whereas for long items, it would be better to have more vertical spacing between items.
  <li> Four. This is the last item in this list.
       Let us terminate the list now without making any more fuss about it.
</ol>
<p>The following is a <code>menu</code> list:</p>
<menu>
  <li> One.
  <li> Two.
  <li> Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer so that it will
probably wrap to the next line in rendering.
</menu>
