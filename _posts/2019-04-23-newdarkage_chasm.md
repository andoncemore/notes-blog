One of the common "origin" stories for engineers is that as children, they took apart complex products to figure out how they work. While it would be nice for everyone to share that mindset, it shouldn't be a necessary condition to living.

What kind of "understanding" is necessary when thinking about systems? There's the kind of understanding of technical details that is expected of engineers. But what other kinds of understanding can be designed into these systems?


*Metaphors:* One way that an understanding of systems can be made is through Metaphors. The chapter brings up the "cloud" as one such metaphor.

These metaphors reduce the complexity of the systems they describe. But then only those who can unwrap that complexity can critique those systems.

*Computational Thinking:* Currently, those people that can unwrap those systems are technologists and tech-solutionists that believe in computational thinking. All new technologies are presented as inherently emancipatory.
