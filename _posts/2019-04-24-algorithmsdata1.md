A few interesting ideas came out of this first meeting:
1. Language is the biggest challenge. How do you describe these complex, technical systems without dumbing stuff down? This connects back to the ideas about system literacy in The New Dark Age
2. Automation and algorithmic technology as parts of a feedback loop that enhances oppression against marginalized communities. These technologies are applied to under resourced areas or places that distrust police, which then just enhance their pre-existing point of view.
3. Predictive policing fits into a longer history of technology being used for the purposes of **identification, placemaking, consensus building, and containment**

### Making
Something that I will be making as part of the research work going on right now is a web-scraper that looks at the LA-City contracts, looking specifically at who the LAPD is using as contractors.

This mini-project brings up an interesting question of technology. I'm building an automated tool that helps community activists, which is the same strategy that data-driven policing is based on. A concern brought up at this meeting was whether making this tool would be hypocritical?

My intuition is that there is a big difference between systemic, institutional use of technology to oppress and community use of the same technology to watch those who are watching us. (Like sousvellience) I'll be thinking more about this question as I make this small tool, though.
